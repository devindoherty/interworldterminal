The last Interworld War ended eighty-eight standard years ago. The most violent conflict the Zolar Star System had ever seen, it claimed the lives of somewhere upwards of a hundred billion sentient creatures. Following the Armistice, the peoples of the Six Worlds came together to create the Interworld Service -- a peacekeeping organization dedicated to preventing another conflict so costly.

In the intervening years, the Interworld Service has largely succeeded. Until now. Tensions are mounting between the former belligerents of the last war, and there are rumors of a darker conspiracy afoot, one that seeks to plunge the star system into chaos, anarchy, and bloodshed once again.
